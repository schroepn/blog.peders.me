        <h2>Class Criticism</h2>
        <p>
          Welp, classes are over, time to criticize! (jk)
        </p>
        <p>
            I would have preferred the CS 347 course to have focused slightly less on html and css because it was very easy to do,
            and instead put more time into the backend and the dynamic webpages part of the class.  The class is apparently going to have a prerequisite 
            soon, which will probably split it up which is good.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also think that the blog posts should have been continued past four weeks.  That would have allowed and easier way to show off
            and experiment with what people learned in class.  The labs are fine, but I didn't really have enough time to finish most of them entirely
            so I felt a bit behind even when I wasn't.  If what I heard about the class getting a prerequisite class was true then this would basically be fixed
            because you could spread the labs out a bit more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally,  I think that the reading should have been gone over a bit more each class.  Even though I rarely had much to ask about
            from the reading, having that small refresher would be helpful. Like above, being able to spread the class out a bit more would be helpful in this regard as well.

            Final Finally, how 2 color theory, as you can tell by this great page i know a lot but... other students, yeah other students might not but I do totally.
