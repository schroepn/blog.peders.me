    <h1>Weekly Learns</h1>
    <p>
        This week I didn't really do much research on HTML or CSS or anything really because im still getting into the groove for school.
        You know how it is, you dont do anything an entire summer and when you have to start doing things again you forget how to do anything.
        I guess I better look for something interesting to learn now.<br>
        One thing I found out: how to make a linebreak.  As I was writing the above I realized I didn't know how to add a linebreak to html, I figured it out from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br">here[1]</a>.
