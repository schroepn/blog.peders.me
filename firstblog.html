    <h2>Weekly Learns</h2>
    <p>
        This week I didn't really do much research on HTML or CSS or anything really because im still getting into the groove for school.
        You know how it is, you dont do anything an entire summer and when you have to start doing things again you forget how to do anything.
        I guess I better look for something interesting to learn now.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing I found out: how to make a linebreak.  As I was writing the above I realized I didn't know how to add a linebreak to html, I figured it out from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br">here[1]</a>.  
        On that same page I learned that I shouldn't use them in case someone with a screen reader reads my page, instead I should use "&lt;p&gt;"".
    </p>
    <p>
        The next thing I learned was how to add the <code><"things within angle brackets"></code>. I checked the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">mdn html homepage[2]</a> and while it didn't show how to do it,
            it had multiple examples of using it by putting the brackets within &lt;code&gt; and adding quotation marks.
        I then looked around for how to actually put brackets (and other special character) into html, and I found a website <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/maruku/markdown_syntax.html">here[3]</a> which taught me to use &amp;lt; for &lt; and &amp;gt; for &gt;.
        After another google search I found a <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">good reference tool [4]</a> with a bunch of html character reference codes that I could use.

    <h2>Pokemon Update</h2>
    <p>
        This is the pokemon update section of my blog. Fun Fact: I've watched a lot of pokemon in my time.  Last year I watched all pokemon from start to season 11.
        I fell off of it because summer happened and I didn't have very good internet.  I plan to watch/consume more pokemon so thats why this section is here.  
        Also I might use this blog for more than just what I learned in HTML and CSS.

    <h2>Other Interesting Things this Week</h2>
    <h3>Anime Club</h3>
    <p>
        I am in the anime club (I'm the treasurer in fact) and as I'm writing this the first club meeting is in 2 and a bit hours.  
        It's exciting to be responsible for a clubs money, and I am also excited for it to be in person for the first time in over a year and to meet new members.
        (technically there was an in person club meeting last week but it was kinda unofficial and it was only for people who were already members [mostly]).
