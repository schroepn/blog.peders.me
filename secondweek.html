        <h2>Weekly Learns</h2>
        <p>
          This week I decided to try to make the blog look a bit better/more aesthetically pleasing.
          As you can see by comparing this blog post to last weeks, there has been improvement. Albeit maybe not that much.
          I used the examples in <a href="https://allover.twodee.org/">the reading for the class [1]</a> to create the monocolumn.
          But I wanted to have a header that popped out.  So after taking the reading and adding <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp">some alignment[2]</a> and color changing,
          I got a new fancy header that says the week for the blog Post.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point I want to get a following header, that follows the web page down. 
          Like what happens to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=now+go+and+scroll+down+the+page">the google search bar[3]</a>
          when you scroll down. I guessed that it was from the <span class="code">style="position: fixed; top: 0px;"</span>
          And after playing around with it a bit, I figured out it was from <span class="code">position:fixed</span>.
          So I added it to this page. Which had&hellip; not so great of an outcome.</p>
          <img src="images/bad_header.png" alt="The header on an unpublished version of this page only took up the left 50% of the screen">
        <p>
          But it was staying at the top of the page when I scrolled down, so there's that.  I just needed to recenter it. Which was pretty easy,
          all I did was make it span the entire page instead of just try to get it to cover only the middle 50%, then I just center aligned the text using
          <span class="code">text-align: center;</span>.
          The final problem: get the main content to sit comfortablly under the header.  I thought it would be just as easy as adding a margin to the main,
          but it also adeded some margin to the header.  So I added padding instead, so now there is technically some empty space under the header,
          but that shouldn't really matter, right?

        <h2>POKEMON</h2>
        <p>
          In other news... I've been playing pokemon go lately, and I finally got the best pokemon in the game: Shuckle.
          Shuckle is <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shuckle_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">pokemon number 213[4]</a>, and shuckle is great.  Shuckle has the highest defense stats in all games, and those defense stats 
          are some of the highest stats period.  No pokemon is as offensive as shuckle is defensive.  
        </p>
