            <p>
                This week, I wanted to improve the look of the blog even more, so time for sidebars with links!
                Looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN's website[1]</a>, it seems to use an aside for the sidebar.
                <img src="/images/91721-1.png" alt="image of mozilla developer page with its insides showing">
                So, now time to add an aside!
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah Yeah, formatting with CSS.  I am going to make an educated guess that they used a flexbox.  And if we check it&hellip;
                I'm not sure.  The CSS I can see talks about <span class="code">grid-row</span> and <span class="code">grid-column</span>.
                Which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column">from what I can understand from MDN[2]</a>
                means that the page is layed out like a 2d grid (whodathunk).  <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-grid-vs-flexbox">According to HubSpot[3]</a> the difference
                between flex and grid is that flex is 1d, while grid is 2d. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                After looking back at the mdn screenshot, I noticed that everything is put into a root div.  Which probably makes it easier when using both.
                Although, I guess I would change whether or not the header was in the root depending on if i used flex or grid.
                I am going to try to use flex, because grid includes grids and, as we all know, grids are scary.

                Now I should probably learn about color theory and learn what colors look good with each other&hellip; Nah.
