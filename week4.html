        <h2>Weekly Learns</h2>
        <p>
          This week, I decided to make last weeks stylesheet the default, and to make a new stylesheet for specifics for each new blog post.
          First, I had to figure out if I could have more than one stylesheet linked (<a href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/can-you-apply-multiple-stylesheets-to-a-single-page/369792/5">hint: you can[1]</a>).
          So then it turns out all I had to do was mak the stylesheet and add another <span class="code">&lt;link&gt;</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week I also decided to look into CSS animation, because Professor Stewart mentioned it and said we didn't need to use it for the upcoming project.
            But I wanna know more!  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation">Time to dive into MDN![2]</a>
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img class="gif" id="moving_circle" src="images/circle_moving.gif" alt="A gif showing a circle moving">
          <figcaption>Have a gif will I learn to animate using css</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          So&hellip;turns out animation is more difficult than just displaying words a certain way, who knew?  I'm going to try to make a <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> with a special color float across the screen.
          If that isn't below this paragraph, you can only assumed I failed, probably both through a lack of trying and because of difficulty.
        </p>
        <figure class="animation">
          <img src="images/shuckle.png">
          <figcaption>weeee</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Welp, would you look at that&hellip;  I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations#examples">the examples on this MDN page[3]</a> to make it.
          So it might not be as hard as I thought, though using it as a response to someone clicking a button will probably require JS, which I don't have experience in.

          <h2>POKEMON</h2>
          <p>
            I've started playing Pokemon UNITE, which is a pokemon MOBA (Moba: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena).  It's pretty fun, I will probably play a bunch more of it whenever I remember it.
            If only they put shuckle in Unite.

          <h2>Other Interesting Things this Week</h2>
          <p>
            As I am the Treasurer of the JMU Anime Club, it is my job to take money and handle money.  
            By September 28<sup>th</sup> I need to finish gathering money from people who are going with the anime club to Katsucon.
            (Katsucon: An anime convention held near DC)
            I have mostly finished collecting from people who said they will go, but a few people have not paid yet, and that means they would have to pay 75$ instead of 60$, 
            not to mention they would have to find their own hotel.
            I plan on sending out an email to those who haven't paid yet to make sure they do so.
